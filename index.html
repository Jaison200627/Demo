<p>CI/CD pipelines, which streamline and accelerate software development, are a reflection of DevOps methodology, a set of ideas and practices that fosters collaboration between developers and IT operations teams.

The CI side of CI/CD refers to continuous integration, which includes building, testing, and merging code. The CD side can stand for continuous delivery, which includes automatically releasing software to a repository. CD can also stand for continuous deployment, which adds the step of automatically deploying software to production.

A CI/CD pipeline guides the process of software development through a path of building, testing, and deploying code. By automating the processes that support CI/CD, development and operations teams can minimize human error and maintain a consistent process for how software is released. Pipelines can include tools for compiling code, unit tests, code analysis, security, and binaries creation. For containerized environments, pipelines will also include tools for packaging the code into a container image to be deployed across a hybrid cloud.

Both CI/CD and DevOps focus on automating processes of code integration, thereby speeding up how an idea (like a new feature, a request for enhancement, or a bug fix) goes from development to deployment in a production environment where it can provide value to the user. Developers, usually coding in a standard development environment, work closely with IT operations to speed software builds, tests, and releasesâ€”without sacrificing reliability.</p>
